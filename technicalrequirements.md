# Technical Requirements

## Frontend

-   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript
    -   **Reasoning:** Next.js provides a fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly foundation for the application. TypeScript adds static typing for improved code quality and maintainability.
-   **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS
    -   **Reasoning:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development and easy customization.
-   **State Management:** React Context or Zustand
    -   **Reasoning:** For managing the application's state, such as the user's input, the list of questions, and the generated replies.
-   **API Communication:** `fetch` API or a library like `axios`.

## Backend

-   **Framework:** Python with FastAPI
    -   **Reasoning:** FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It's easy to use and provides automatic interactive documentation.
-   **Multi-Agent System:** N8N
    -   **Reasoning:** A free, source-available, and scalable workflow automation tool. It can be used for multi-agent orchestration, allowing for the creation and management of agents through a user-friendly UI. Agent configurations can be stored in JSON files, which keeps the codebase clean and makes modifications easy.
-   **Language Model:** A powerful language model from a provider like OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude 3), or Google (Gemini).
-   **Data Sources:**
    -   Reddit API (via PRAW library)
    -   Potentially other APIs for platforms like Quora, Stack Overflow, etc.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite
    -   **Reasoning:** For storing user data, product descriptions, and the history of generated replies. PostgreSQL is recommended for production for its scalability and robustness.

## API Specification

The backend will expose a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

-   `POST /api/v1/questions`
    -   **Request Body:** `{ "product_description": "..." }`
    -   **Response:** `{ "questions": [ { "id": "...", "title": "...", "url": "..." } ] }`
-   `POST /api/v1/replies`
    -   **Request Body:** `{ "question_ids": ["..."], "product_description": "..." }`
    -   **Response:** `{ "replies": [ { "id": "...", "question_id": "...", "text": "..." } ] }`
-   `POST /api/v1/regenerate`
    -   **Request Body:** `{ "reply_id": "..." }`
    -   **Response:** `{ "reply": { "id": "...", "text": "..." } }`

## Deployment

-   **Frontend:** Vercel or Netlify
    -   **Reasoning:** These platforms are optimized for hosting Next.js applications and provide a seamless deployment experience with CI/CD integration.
-   **Backend:** A cloud provider like AWS (EC2 or Lambda), Google Cloud (Cloud Run), or Microsoft Azure.
    -   **Reasoning:** These providers offer a range of services for deploying and scaling Python applications.
-   **Database:** A managed database service like Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or a self-hosted database on a virtual machine.
